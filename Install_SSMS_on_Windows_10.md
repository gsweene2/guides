# Install SSMS on Window 10

1. Go to the Microsoft [Download SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) page

2. Click the `Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)` Link, or go here: https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup

3. It should download a file in you Downloads directory that looks like this: `SSMS-Setup-ENU.exe`

4. Run the executable, and you should see a window to start the Install

  * Note the Release (Mine 18.4)
  * Note the install location (Mine `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18`)
  
5. Click the `Install` button. You'll see Package Progress and Overall Progress

  * I got an error `Fatal error during installation` - `A previous installation required a reboot of the machine for changes to take effect. To proceed, srestart your computer and then run Setup again`
  * So I will do this
